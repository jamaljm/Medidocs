## Problem MediDoc Solves

- Patients often have to rely on printed copies of medical records or incomplete summaries of their medical history, which can lead to miscommunication and errors in treatment. Healthcare providers also face challenges in accessing up-to-date medical data, which can lead to delays in treatment or inappropriate medical decisions.

- There are many fraudants happening in the Insurance industry as verification of medical records is extremely hard . According to a recent survey, it is estimated that the number of false claims in the Industry is approximately 15% of total claims. The report suggests that the Healthcare Industry in India is losing approximately Rs. 600-Rs. 800 crores incurred on fraudulent claims annually.

- There is also a lack of a secure way to perform and train AI models on such data. Current AI models are relatively bad at Medical analysis as there is a large lack of data on Medical activities due to privacy concerns


## Solution
- Utilising Medibloc, patients and healthcare professionals can store and analyse medical information like electronic health records, test results, and treatment histories. This data is kept secure and private by being stored on a decentralised network.

- MediDocs allows the doctors to perform various analytic models on the patients data . One such model that we did was the Detection of early stage Breast Cancer

- This data can be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) models and make predictions based on that data. These predictions can be used to identify trends and patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent to healthcare providers. For example, AI algorithms can be used to identify patients who are at high risk of developing certain medical conditions or to suggest treatment options based on a patient's medical history.

- Medidocs uses  federated learning as a way to improve the accuracy of the AI models it trains without compromising patient data privacy. For example, a machine learning model could be trained on a patient's local device or healthcare provider's system, and the trained model could be shared with MediDocs to be combined with other models to improve the overall accuracy of the system.





## Key Features

* Secure storage of medical data using AES.
* Patient-controlled access.
* Easily sharable using QR Code

## Challenges we ran into
- Third web documentation was a headache and implementation was not clear . 
- Lack of time to complete the federative learning model and its hosting on thirdweb
- Dataset for training the breast cancer model was hard to get
